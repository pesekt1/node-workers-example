- [Redis](https://redis.io/)



## Application Overview

The application is comprised of two process: 

- **`web`** - An [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that serves the frontend assets, accepts new background jobs, and reports on the status us existing jobs
- **`worker`** - A small node process that listens for and executes incoming jobs

Because these are separate processes, they can be scaled independently based on specific application needs. Read the [Process Model](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model) article for a more in-depth understanding of Herokuâ€™s process model.

The `web` process serves the `index.html` and `client.js` files which implement a simplified example of a frontend interface that kicks off new jobs and checks in on them...
